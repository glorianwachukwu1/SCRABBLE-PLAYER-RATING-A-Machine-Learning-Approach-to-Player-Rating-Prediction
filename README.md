# SCRABBLE-PLAYER-RATING-A-Machine-Learning-Approach-to-Player-Rating-Prediction




"Scrabble Player Rating: A Machine Learning Approach to Player Rating Prediction" presents an innovative application of machine learning in the context of Scrabble tournaments. The project's primary objective is to develop and implement a machine learning model to predict and refine player ratings using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric.
The dataset, sourced from Woogles.io, encompasses over 73,000 Scrabble games played by three bots and human opponents. Comprising four key components (train.csv, games.csv, turns.csv, test.csv), the dataset provides valuable insights into player performance, paving the way for a more transparent and reliable Scrabble Player Rating system.

As players engage in Scrabble tournaments, honing their skills with each match, this project will not only provide a numerical representation of a player's skill but will help foster a competitive environment where participants are pitted against opponents of similar abilities, ensuring engaging and challenging gameplay for all. 
Overall, this research marks a significant step forward in the application of artificial intelligence to traditional board games, showcasing the potential of machine learning to revolutionize how we evaluate player performance in intellectual games like Scrabble.
